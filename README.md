# EV Charging Station Placer
A program I wrote for my Software for Renewable Energy class.
It uses the National Renewable Energy Lab API to find all locations of EV Chargers in a given state. An algorithm finds the farthest distance from all other charging stations, as well as the edge of the state. The program then uses the Google Maps API to snap this location to the nearest road.
